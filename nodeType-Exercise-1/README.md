1. Create an HTML file that contains at least one of each of the following Node types:
- DocumnetType (DocType)
- Element
- Comment
- Text

2. Open your HTML file in your brower's dev tools and inspect each of the nodes, then switch to the console to log out that node's "NodeType" propety to confirm it is correct.

*HINT: You can inspeact a specific element then use
            $0 un the console tab to refer to it
            (eg: $0.nodeType)
